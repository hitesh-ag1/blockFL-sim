blockFL-sim is a Python-based simulator to run decentralized federated learning applications. Our aim is to boost research in blockchain based FL by providing an easy to setup infrastructure which can be easily configured to test:
- Robustness to limited availability of clients
- Convergence under non-IID data distribution
- Model averaging schemes for fast convergence
- Schemes for malicious actors
- Generalizing compressed communication schemes from centralized setting
